# 🏨 Hotel Network Design – Cisco Packet Tracer

This project simulates a hotel management system network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, developed as part of the **ITT400 – Introduction to Data Communication and Networking** course.

## 📁 Project Overview
The network is designed for a fictional hotel, **De’ Scarlet Hotel**, to demonstrate secure and efficient internal communication across departments using proper networking protocols and topology.

### 🔧 Features
- VLAN configuration for department segmentation  
- Routers and multilayer switches for core connectivity  
- HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) for redundancy  
- EtherChannel for link aggregation and performance  
- Servers: reservation, database, and file server setup  
- IP addressing and subnetting  
- Basic troubleshooting simulated in Packet Tracer

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Networking Concepts (Routing, Switching, VLAN, Redundancy)

## 📂 Files Included
- `hotel-network.pkt` – The full network simulation file  
- `README.md` – Project description and documentation  

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
This project enhanced my skills in real-world network infrastructure design, redundancy protocols, and communication reliability in large-scale environments.
